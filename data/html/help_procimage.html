<h2>Processing images</h2>
There are two ways to process images added to the project.<br> 

<ul>
	<li> Process only one image, displayed at the Image Viewer
	<li> Process all images at ones.
</ul>
<br><br>
The perform first type of processing for the desirable image the <b>Process</b> button (<img src="../graphics/process.png" alt="Process">) or the corresponding option
from the <b>Run</b> menu has to be clicked. This method is the most suitable when it is necessary to tune the parameters of the cell detection algorithm separately
for each input file.
<br>
<br>
The second method allows to set the processing parameters only once and use them for each image from the project. To do that the <b>Process all</b> button (<img src="../graphics/process_all.png" alt="Process all">)
or option from the <b>Run</b> menu has to be clicked.
