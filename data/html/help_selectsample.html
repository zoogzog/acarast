<h2>Selecting samples</h2>

Each input image consists of one control and at least one experimental sample. Cell Analyzer allows user to choose between manual and automatic
sample detection. 
<br>
<br>

<b>Automatic sample detection</b><br>
For automatic sample detection it is necessary to specify the desirable amount of samples and the index of the control samples.
In some cases if an image lacks contrast and the sample borders are not clearly visible and the application could not correctly find samples.
To overcome this problem the system could be tuned by changing processing settings (menu <b>Help</b> option <b>Settings</b>), or by selecting
samples manually.
<br><br>

<b>Manual samples selection</b>
Samples could be chosen manually. In order to do it, first it is necessary to activate manual mode which is done by selecting <b>Manual</b>
from the <b>Sample detection method</b> menu. Next the sample area could be selected by enabling area selection (button <b>Select sample</b> 
<img src="../graphics/select.png" alt="Select sample">) and dragging area on the displayed image. Already selected area could be moved by enabling
sample moving mode (button <b>Move sample</b> <img src="../graphics/move.png" alt="Move">).
Finally selected area could be added as a sample, or an existing sample could be deleted by clicking buttons <b>Add sample</b>,
 <b>Add control sample</b>, <b>Delete sample</b> located in the sample manager. In order to start processing it is necessary to specify one control
 and at least one test sample.
