<h2>Viewing results</h2>
<br>

<b>Viewing images</b><br>
The are several ways to check the results of cell detection and feature extraction. Detected samples could be viewed by selecting
them from the sample box in the <b>Project manager</b>. The detected cells could be viewed by choosing the <b>Show detected cells</b>
or <b>Show colored cells</b> options in the <b>View</b> menu. The first method will draw boundary boxes around detected cells and 
the second one will colored cells on a black background. The image with boundary boxes could also be viewed by clicking the 
<b>View cells</b> button (<img src="../graphics/o_image.png" alt="View cells">).
<br><br>

<b>Extracted features</b>
Features, extracted from the detected cells could be viewed in the <b>Output viewer</b>. All the features are divided into three categories:
length frequency histogram, absolute features and relative features. The length frequency histogram represents the frequency of cells of each 
particular length. Absolute features are features extracted from the sample and relative features are sample features in relation to control sample
features.<br><br>

<b>Absolute features</b>
<ul>
	<li><b>Cell count</b> total amount of detected cells</li>
	
	<li><b>Cell length</b> features are average, minimum and maximum cell lengths</li>
	
	<li><b>Interval</b> is a confidence interval, where X amount of bacteria with the length in this interval are located. X is specified by the parameter
	<b>Confidence interval</b> in the <b>Settings</b> menu.</li>
	
	<li><b>Cell area</b> features are an average, minimum and maximum cell areas</li>
	
	<li><b>Average width</b> is an average cell width</li>
	
	<li><b>Length deviation</b> is the standard deviation of the cell lengths</li>
	
	<li><b>Total pixel density</b> is a relation between amount of pixels which are cells and total amount of pixels of the selected sample</li>
	
	<li><b>Shape descriptor</b> represents how close the cell shape to a line. The close it is the closer the value to 1.</li>

</ul>

<br>

<b>Relative features</b>
<ul>
	<li><b>Total cell count</b> is a cell count of the sample divided on cell count of the controls sample</li>
	<li><b>Equal to control</b> is amount of cells from the sample which length is in the confidence interval of the control sample</li>
	<li><b>Average length</b> is test sample average length divided on control sample average length</li>
	<li><b>Length deviation</b> is length deviation in relation to the control sample</li>
	<li><b>Average area</b> is the average area of the test sample divided on average area of the control sample</li>
	<li><b>Total pixel density</b> is the pixel density of the test sample divided on the pixel density of the control sample</li>
	<li><b>Interval length</b> is a relation between the test sample confidence length interval and the control sample interval</li>
	<li><b>Shape descriptor</b> is a test sample shape descriptor divded on the control sample descriptor</li>
	<li><b>Level of difference</b> represents how different is the test sample from the control sample. The closer the value to 0 the closer
	the sample to the control sample</li>

</ul>
