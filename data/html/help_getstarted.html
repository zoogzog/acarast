<h2>Getting started</h2>

<b>Processing a file</b>
<br>
The easiest way to start using the application and processing image files is to add a file with an <b>Open file</b> button
(<img src="../graphics/select_file.png" alt="Open file button">). Opened file will be displayed in the Image Viewer and
could be zoomed in and out with the mouse wheel. To process this file the <b>Process</b> button 
(<img src="../graphics/process.png" alt="Process button">) or <b>Process</b> option from the menu <b>Run</b> has to be clicked.<br>

During image processing and cell detection it is not allowed to add any new files or samples as well as saving results, however 
it is possible to view images and already detected samples.
<br><br>

<b>Tool Manager</b>
<br>
Tool manager contains the main menu and the toolbar. With the tools from the toolbar and menu user can add files to the project,
view the added images, select samples and move them across the image, perform processing and saving the output results.
