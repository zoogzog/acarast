<b>Zooming in and out</b><br>
All images added to the current project could be viewed in the Image Viewer by selecting them in the Project Manager.
It is possible to zoom in and zoom out the displayed image by either clicking the <b>Zoom in</b> (<img src="../graphics/zoom_in.png" alt="Zoom in">),
<b>Zoom out</b> (<img src="../graphics/zoom_out.png" alt="Zoom out">) buttons, selecting the <b>Zoom in</b>, <b>Zoom out</b> options in the <b>View</b> menu or rotating 
the mouse wheel. The zooming factor is displayed in the right bottom corner of the workspace.
<br><br>

<b>Moving image</b><br>

<b>Reseting image view</b>
When it is necessary to quickly reset the image view the easiest way to do is it to click the <b>Refresh</b> button (<img src="../graphics/refresh.png" alt="Refresh">) or select the <b>Fit to screen</b> 
option in the View menu. This will resets the zooming factor and moves the image back to the center.
