<h2>Advanced Settings</h2>

Advanced settings could be accessed by selecting the <b>Settings</b> option in the <b>Help</b> menu. 
By tuning the settings it is possible to increase the sample and cell detection accuracy for a particular noisy or
poorly illuminated sample.
<br>
<br>

The settings menu is separated into four categories: image processing, sample detection, cell detection and feature extraction.
It is suggested that in case if the system could not correctly detect cell samples to change the <b>Sample Detector Settings</b>
and if it is necessary to increase the accuracy of cell detection <b>Cell Detector Settings</b> has to be tuned.
<br>
<br>

<b>Image Processing Settings</b><br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Gaussian kernel size</b> represents the kernel size in <b>pixels</b> of the gaussian filter which used for correction image illumination.
	Small values of this parameter could correct illumination more efficiently, however information about some bacteria cells could be lost.</li>
	
	<li><b>Canny edge threshold</b> is the <b>intensity</b> level which used for detecting the edges of the image. Lowering this value could help
	to detect image cell samples correctly.</li>
	
	<li><b>Dilate kernel size</b> is the size of dilation filter in <b>pixels</b>. Increasing this value could also help to detect cell samples.</li>
	
	<li><b>Local threshold kernel size</b> parameter is used for correctly detecting cells on the image and not treating noise as cells. It is assumed
	that cells are consist of dark pixels, so if in the area of some pixel, specified by <b>Local threshold kernel size</b> there is not dark
	pixels which less then <b>Local threshold condition</b> this pixel's intensity is changed to be the <b>Local threshold</b> value.Thus
	increasing the <b>Local threshold kernel size</b> will make more pixels to be treated as bacteria cells.</li>
	
	<li><b>Local threshold condition</b> represents the <b>intensity</b> level condition for local thresholding (see <b>Local threshold kernel size</b>).
	 Increasing this value will make more pixels to be treated as cells.</li>
	 
	<li><b>Local threshold destination value</b> specifies the <b>intensity</b> which will be assigned to a pixel if it does not satisfy
	the <b>Local threshold condition</b>. It is recommended not to change this parameter. For more information see <b>Local threshold kernel size</b> parameter.</li>
	
	<li><b>Global threshold</b> is the <b>intensity</b> parameter for an ordinary thresholding.</li>
</ul><br>

<b>Sample Detector Settings</b><br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Hough transform rho</b> is a distance parameter of the Hough transform</li>
	<li><b>Hough transform theta</b> is an angle parameter of the Hough transform</li>
	<li><b>Hough transform threshold</b> is a threshold parameter for lines detected with the Hough transform</li>
	<li><b>Hough transform min length</b> is a minimum length of the segment to be detected as line. Increasing this parameter could help to
	detect sample correctly</li>
	<li><b>Hough transform max gap</b> is a maximum gap between segments to be merge. Lowering this value could help to detec sample borders.</li>
	<li><b>Offset to narrow sample</b> specifies the amount of pixels on which all borders will be moved to narrow down the sample widths. Narrowing samples
	is necessary in order to not to detect sample border pixels as cell pixels.</li>
	<li><b>Sample border width</b> is the width of sample border in pixels. Setting this parameter correctly will increase accuracy of the sample 
	border estimation</li>
	<li><b>Border intensity drop min</b> and <b>Border intensity drop max</b> represent the drop intensity on the border, 
	lowering the minimum and increasing the maximum parameter could help to detect samples.</li>
</ul><br>

<b>Cell Detector Settings</b><br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Min bacteria size</b> specifies the minimum size of cells in <b>pixels</b>. All detected objects with size less then specified will be treated
	as noise.</li>
	
	<li><b>Max cell distance</b> is the maximum distance in <b>pixels</b> between cells</li>
	<li><b>Max angle between cells</b></li>
</ul><br>

<b>Feature Extractor Settings</b><br>
<ul>
	<li><b>Frequency histogram steps</b> is the amount of bins in the length frequency histogram</li>
	<li><b>Confidence interval</b> is the desirable maximum amount of the bacteria cells with certain length in the interval.</li>
</ul>
